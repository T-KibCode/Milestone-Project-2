# Milestone-Project-2

# Introduction
This project is the second one I've undertaken as part of the Full Stack Software Diploma course at [Codeinstitute.net](https://www.CodeInstitute.net).

This Project is going to be to create a 2 player 2d fighting game similar to street fighter from the pre 2001 era and back, harkening back to these old school games.
It was my original intent to Allow the game to use an opaque overlay in order to be able to play the devce on mobile. 

However during the design process, it became very quickly apprant that Allowing the website in a mobile or tablet function would be extremely difficult due to having to map a button overlay on top, and as I had originally designed the game to be playable by two human players without a CPU controlled enemy, I was unfortunately unable to integrate a method to do this over mobile/tablet devices. 

Second milestone project with the code institute

I'm building this website in such a way that If a user loads/lands on the site, it is immidately clear what his USP is , what the website provides for information/service's, and how to employ these services whilst keeping the user engaged at all points. 

As I add to this website, I will also update the readme file with explanations behind certain choices in this build. 

Run Python script python3 -m http.server in order to see a preview of the project. 

I'm arranging the website to have a four photo hero image under the following;
Songwriting/Producing, Mixing, Photography, Videography

Needs Hover Functions within javascript to enhance user activity. 

I have added the click events and fixed my "keys.pressed.{insert key}" issue which was a typo, making it more apparamt that typos during the writing process of the code, need to have special attention paid to them in order to ensure an efficient process overall.
