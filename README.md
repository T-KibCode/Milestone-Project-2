# Milestone-Project-2
Second milestone project with the code institute
This Project is going to be to create a booking website to serve as a Portfolio for a Musical aqquintance of mine. 

This is to serve as both his online portfolio for his works in music, but also in photography/videograpy.

I'm building this website in such a way that If a user loads/lands on the site, it is immidately clear what his USP is, what the website provides for information/service's, and how to employ these services whilst keeping the user engaged at all points. 

As I add to this website, I will also update the readme file with explanations behind certain choices in this build. 

Run Python script python3 -m http.server in order to see a preview of the project.
