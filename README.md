# Milestone-Project-2

# Introduction
This project is the second one I've undertaken as part of the Full Stack Software Diploma course at [Codeinstitute.net](https://www.CodeInstitute.net).

This Project is going to be to create a 2-Player 2D fighting game similar to street fighter from the pre 2001 era and back, harkening back to these old school games. This was done as a passion project that the younger version of me would have been proud of.

I also designed so that if two friends wanted to play a quick match with, they could have a quick session playing the game before getting on with any other tasks. 

I believe that two dimensional fighting games encourage reactive and critical thinking within players.

This is because within the parameters of this particular gaming medium, we find ourselves trying to read our opponenets habits, and in turn, predictiing their movements so that we can gain an advantage within the match, whether that be in moving to dodge their movesset, or making false moves in order to lay a trap for an opponents that is trying to read us as the player!

  ### User Stories
  
  ##### First Time Visitor Goals
  As a first time visitor I want:  
  - the control inputs for the game to be clear.  
  - to be immidately engaged and inherently understand what the game is trying to acheive.  
  - the game to function correctly and gameplay to be intuitive.  
  - to be able to play the game on various compatiable different devices in line with the game design.  
  
  ##### Return/frequent Visitor Goals.
  As a return/frequent visitor I want:  
  - to play with friends in a couch co-op setup similar to the older arcade games in order to have that rapport with the opponent within the room. 
  
  ##### Website's Owner Goals.
  As the developer I want:
  - to provide a fun game.
  - to provide a game to stimulate mental function.
  - to encourage continued use of the game.


##### Colour Scheme 
Due to having some free assets that I aqquired online from website [https://itch.io/](https://itch.io/),  I had a clear colour pallette style within the canvas window that I wanted to be the main focus with a combination of Blue, Pinks, soft Reds and other colors in the Pastel style.

With this in mind, the background colour was going to be fairly static in theme with this and I ended up on a pastel pink background color With the game instructions placed above the canvas with the prompt of clicking into the canvas window to load the game. 

I decided to use a free to use font for personal/educational use modeled after the original street fighter font released in 1991.

# Features




It was my original intent to Allow the game to use an opaque overlay in order to be able to play the devce on mobile devices. 

However during the design process, it became very quickly apprant that allowing the website in a mobile or tablet function would be extremely difficult due to having to map a button overlay on top, and as I had originally designed the game to be playable by two human players without a CPU controlled enemy, I was unfortunately unable to integrate a method to do this over mobile/tablet devices due to not having designed a CPU based opponent in the code. 

Due to a lack of time, this was not a function that I was able to integrate at this moment in time, however I do plan to revisit this once the course has been completed to be able to design a very basic CPU opponent within the game function and allow players to be able to have a choice between a second player or a CPU opponent.
