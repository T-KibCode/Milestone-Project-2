# Milestone-Project-2
Second milestone project with the code institute
This Project is going to be to create a 2 player 2d fighting game similar to street fighter from the pre 2001 era and back, harkening back to these old school games.


I'm building this website in such a way that If a user loads/lands on the site, it is immidately clear what his USP is , what the website provides for information/service's, and how to employ these services whilst keeping the user engaged at all points. 

As I add to this website, I will also update the readme file with explanations behind certain choices in this build. 

Run Python script python3 -m http.server in order to see a preview of the project. 

I'm arranging the website to have a four photo hero image under the following;
Songwriting/Producing, Mixing, Photography, Videography

Needs Hover Functions within javascript to enhance user activity. 

I have added the click events and fixed my "keys.pressed.{insert key}" issue which was a typo, making it more apparamt that typos during the writing process of the code, need to have special attention paid to them in order to ensure an efficient process overall.
