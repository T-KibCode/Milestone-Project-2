# Milestone-Project-2

# Introduction
This project is the second one I've undertaken as part of the Full Stack Software Diploma course at [Codeinstitute.net](https://www.CodeInstitute.net).

This Project is going to be to create a 2-Player 2D fighting game similar to street fighter from the pre 2001 era and back, harkening back to these old school games.


It was my original intent to Allow the game to use an opaque overlay in order to be able to play the devce on mobile devices. 

However during the design process, it became very quickly apprant that allowing the website in a mobile or tablet function would be extremely difficult due to having to map a button overlay on top, and as I had originally designed the game to be playable by two human players without a CPU controlled enemy, I was unfortunately unable to integrate a method to do this over mobile/tablet devices due to not having designed a CPU based opponent in the code. 

Due to a lack of time, this was not a function that I was able to integrate at this moment in time, however I do plan to revisit this once the course has been completed to be able to design a very basic CPU opponent within the game function and allow players to be able to have a choice between a second player or a CPU opponent.
